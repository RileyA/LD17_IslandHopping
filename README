My LD #17 game. It got 7th place overall, and a version with a high score table 
and stuff tacked on turned out pretty popular (by my standards at least... the
high score table had 1.8 million scores, and it was featured in a French
games magazine somewhere).

Gross 48 hour code, but I thought it was worth keeping around anyways... I'm
working on and off on a remake of this game (see the other repo).

Let's call it GPL'd, but I doubt anyone would want to use any of it.
